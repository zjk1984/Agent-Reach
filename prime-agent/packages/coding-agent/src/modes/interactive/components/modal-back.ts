/**
 * Shared helper for treating the left arrow as "go back" inside dialogs.
 *
 * The left arrow is bound to `app.modal.back` so that, like Esc, it dismisses a
 * dialog and returns to the previous screen. Dialogs that contain a text field
 * (model filter, login input, session search) must not steal the left arrow
 * while the user is editing: it only acts as back when the field is empty or the
 * cursor is already at the start (column 0). This mirrors the chat editor's
 * existing `onAgentsBack` guard so behaviour stays consistent across the app.
