# Long-Running and Background Agents

Prime Agent combines daemon-backed session workers with persistent state, scheduled prompts, direct agent messaging, goals, and bounded autonomous continuations. These features serve different purposes but share the same session and worker runtime.

    client <-->|"attach · detach · commands"| supervisor
    peer -->|"direct message"| supervisor
    supervisor --> queue
    session --> artifacts
    artifacts -. "restore after restart" .-> session
```

The client can detach at any point. The resident worker continues to own the queue, schedules, session, kernel, descendants, and persisted state.

## Daemon-Backed Sessions

Normal interactive sessions run in resident worker processes managed by a local supervisor. The worker owns the root session, its IPython kernel, scheduled jobs, and RLM descendants.

Closing the terminal UI detaches the client; it does not stop the worker. List and reconnect to active agents with:

```bash
prime-agent list
prime-agent attach <agent>
```

Other lifecycle commands are:

```bash
prime-agent agents                  # Open the agents view
prime-agent rename <agent> <name>   # Give an agent a stable readable name
prime-agent stop <agent>            # Stop one agent
prime-agent status                  # Inspect background services
prime-agent doctor [--fix]          # Diagnose or repair service state
prime-agent shutdown [--force]      # Stop all agents and services
```

Workers persist transcripts as JSONL and store feature-specific state under the session artifact directory. A worker or supervisor restart can recover session state and schedules and rehydrate retained completed RLM children without treating a terminal client as the owner of the work.

Daemon workers are process-isolated for lifecycle and failure containment, not security-sandboxed. They normally run with the same operating-system permissions as the client.

## Agent-to-Agent Communication

The daemon routes direct messages between active sessions and retained daemon-backed subagents. From a shell:

```bash
prime-agent send <agent> "Please verify the latest migration"
```

From the IPython kernel, use the preloaded `agent_message` Python skill:

```python
roster = await agent_message.list_agents()
receipt = await agent_message.send(
    "Recheck the endpoint after the latest edit",
    receiver_role="sibling",
    receiver_name="api-reviewer",
    mode="auto",
)
print(receipt["deliveryStatus"])
```

For the current parent's direct RLM children, prefer the parent-scoped registry:

```python
children = await rlm.list_subagents()
child = next(item for item in children if item.session_name == "api-reviewer")
await agent_message.send(
    "Continue with the updated diff",
    receiver_role="child",
    receiver_name=child.session_name,
)
```

Delivery modes are:

- `auto`: steer a busy target and deliver immediately to an idle target;
- `steer`: intentionally inject the message into active work; and
- `follow_up`: wait until the target's current work finishes.

A receipt is `delivered` when it reached an idle target's context or `queued` when accepted for later delivery. `agent_message.send("all", message)` broadcasts only within the family roster. The daemon derives sender identity and enforces message-size, rate, and pending-queue limits.

## Heartbeats and Scheduled Prompts

Prime Agent has three related scheduling surfaces:

| Surface | Owner | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/heartbeat` | User | One visible recurring instruction for the current session. |
| `rlm_heartbeat` | Agent | Multiple programmatically managed recurring instructions internal to the current session. |
| `prime-agent schedule` | User or automation | General one-time or cron prompts targeted at an agent. |

### User heartbeat

Create and manage the current session's visible heartbeat:

```text
/heartbeat every 10m Check the deployment and report meaningful changes
/heartbeat status
/heartbeat pause
/heartbeat resume
/heartbeat clear
```

Heartbeat delivery defaults to steering active work. Add `--follow-up` when the recurring prompt should wait until the current turn finishes. Use `/heartbeats` to inspect and manage both user and agent-created heartbeats.

### Agent-created RLM heartbeats

An agent can create several internal heartbeats programmatically:

```python
first = await rlm_heartbeat.create(
    "check whether the test run finished",
    interval="5m",
    label="tests",
)
second = await rlm_heartbeat.create(
    "inspect the deployment status",
    interval="10m",
    label="deploy",
    delivery_mode="follow_up",
)

await rlm_heartbeat.list()
await rlm_heartbeat.update(first["heartbeat"]["id"], status="pause")
```

RLM heartbeats are distinct from the user's `/heartbeat`; the Python skill cannot replace or clear the user-owned heartbeat.

### General schedules

Schedule a one-time or recurring prompt for an addressable agent:

```bash
prime-agent schedule add worker "in 30m" -- "Check the benchmark result"
prime-agent schedule add worker "0 9 * * 1-5" -- "Review open work"
prime-agent schedule list --all
prime-agent schedule cancel <job-id>
```

Scheduled jobs are persisted per session and continue while the UI is detached. Due ticks are claimed before delivery so a crash does not replay an uncertain prompt, and missed ticks are coalesced rather than accumulated into an unbounded backlog.

## Persistent Goals

A goal is a durable objective that the harness continues to present across turns until it is complete, paused, budget-limited, errored, or cleared. Start one explicitly from the TUI:

```text
/goal Ship the release and verify every published artifact
/goal --budget 200000 Complete the repository migration
```

Manage its state with:

```text
/goal status
/goal pause
/goal resume
/goal clear
```

The model uses the kernel-side `goal` skill to inspect or finish the objective:

```python
state = await goal.get()
await goal.complete()
```

Goal state records token usage, elapsed time, continuation count, and an optional explicit token budget. The harness keeps prompting an active goal after ordinary assistant turns; only `goal.complete()` marks successful completion. Creating a persistent goal is an explicit user or host action, not something the agent should infer from every task.

## Autonomous Mode

Autonomous mode is a bounded host policy for runs where no human input is expected. Prime Agent adds follow-up continuations until configured quality gates pass or a continuation, turn, token, or wall-clock limit is reached.

Enable it in an interactive session:

```text
/autonomous on
/autonomous status
/autonomous off
```

Or configure a run from the CLI:

```bash
prime-agent \
  --autonomous \
  --autonomous-gate "npm run check" \
  --autonomous-max-turns 20 \
  "Implement and verify the requested change"
```

Autonomous mode supports limits for continuations, assistant turns, tokens, and wall-clock duration. Gate commands run before the session may finish; a failed gate returns its bounded output to the agent for another attempt. Prime Agent avoids rerunning the same failed gate when the workspace has not changed.

Goals and autonomous mode are complementary but different:

- a **goal** stores the objective and its progress state across turns;
- **autonomous mode** decides whether to inject another continuation based on evidence, gates, and limits.

## Compaction and Continuity

Automatic compaction handles context growth during long tasks. On overflow or near the configured threshold, Prime Agent summarizes older messages, retains recent context, and continues. The IPython kernel persists through compaction, so variables, imports, helper functions, and task state remain available.

The agent can inspect or request compaction programmatically:

```python
await compact.status()
await compact.run("Preserve the failing tests and remaining migration steps")
```

Compaction is not a completion signal. It does not stop goals, autonomous continuations, heartbeats, or existing child sessions; later parent turns continue from the compacted context.
