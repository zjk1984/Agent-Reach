description: Create, validate, and install Prime Agent skills - both markdown skills and Python-backed skills callable from the IPython kernel. Use when the user asks to create a skill, turn a workflow, script, or prompt into a reusable skill, add a Python skill the agent can call, or asks how to write a SKILL.md and where skills live.

# Skill Creator

A skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file (YAML frontmatter + markdown instructions). At startup Prime Agent reads only each skill's name and description into the system prompt; the full file loads on demand when a task matches. Prime Agent follows the [Agent Skills standard](https://agentskills.io/specification) and extends it with Python-backed skills.

| Kind | What it is | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| markdown | `SKILL.md` plus optional scripts, references, and assets | Workflows, CLI recipes, domain knowledge, multi-step instructions |
| python | A markdown skill that also ships a Python package installed into the agent's persistent IPython kernel | Capabilities that are naturally one Python call: API wrappers, fetchers, converters, computations |

Before writing a Python-backed skill, read [references/python-skills.md](references/python-skills.md) for the package contract.

## Creating a Skill

1. **Pick the kind.** Default to markdown. Go Python only when the agent should *call* the capability (`await my_skill(...)`) instead of following instructions.
2. **Pick the location.** Ask the user when it is not obvious from context:
   - Project skill, shared via the repo: `.prime/agent/skills/<name>/`
   - Personal global skill: `~/.prime/agent/skills/<name>/`
   - Shipped with an npm package: a `skills/` directory in the package, or `pi.skills` paths in its `package.json`
3. **Scaffold and write** the directory using the layout and frontmatter rules below.
4. **Verify** the skill loads (see Verification).

On a name collision the first skill found wins. Precedence: explicit `--skill` paths and `skills` settings entries, then project, then global, then package, then built-in skills.

## Layout

```
my-skill/
├── SKILL.md              # Required: frontmatter + instructions
├── scripts/              # Optional helper scripts the instructions reference
├── references/           # Optional detailed docs, loaded only when needed
└── assets/               # Optional templates and data files
```

Everything except `SKILL.md` is freeform. Reference files with paths relative to the skill directory; the agent resolves them against the directory containing `SKILL.md`.

## Frontmatter

```markdown
---
name: my-skill
description: What this skill does and when to use it. Be specific.
---
```

| Field | Required | Rules |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | Yes | Max 64 chars. Lowercase a-z, 0-9, hyphens. No leading/trailing/consecutive hyphens. Must match the parent directory name. |
| `description` | Yes | Max 1024 chars. A skill with a missing or empty description is **silently not loaded**. |
| `disable-model-invocation` | No | `true` hides the skill from the system prompt; only explicit `/skill:<name>` invokes it. |
| `license` | No | License name or reference to a bundled file. |
| `compatibility` | No | Max 500 chars. Environment requirements. |
| `metadata` | No | Arbitrary key-value mapping. |
| `allowed-tools` | No | Space-delimited pre-approved tools (experimental). |

Unknown fields are ignored. Name violations produce warnings but the skill still loads.

### Write the description for routing

The description is the only thing the model sees before deciding to load the skill. State what the skill does *and* the trigger conditions ("Use when ..."), naming the concrete tasks, tools, and phrases a request would contain.

Good: `Extracts text and tables from PDF files, fills PDF forms, and merges PDFs. Use when working with PDF documents.`
Poor: `Helps with PDFs.`

### Write the body for progressive disclosure

Keep `SKILL.md` short: the decision flow, the common commands, the contract. Push exhaustive detail (API schemas, full option lists, long examples) into `references/*.md` and link them, so they only enter context when actually needed. State setup steps (installs, env vars, credentials) explicitly and early.

## Verification

After writing the skill:

1. Re-read the frontmatter and check every rule in the table above, especially that `name` matches the directory name and the description is non-empty.
2. In an interactive session, `/reload` picks up new skills without a restart; other sessions pick them up on start. Loading problems (bad name, missing description, name collisions) surface as warnings — ask the user to check, or check diagnostics yourself if you can.
3. A loaded skill is also invocable as `/skill:<name>`, which the user can try directly.

For Python-backed skills, also run the checks in [references/python-skills.md](references/python-skills.md).
